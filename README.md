 ### PHP Coding Standards Fixer

 The PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool fixes your code to follow standards.

 - `composer sniff`: The --dry-run flag will run the fixer without making changes to your files.
 - `composer lint`

> You can find the config file at the root of the project `.php-cs-fixer.php`
